		<para>Although this agent will work with a large number of custom Apache builds 
		out there, it is primarily designed to work with Apache-derived servers embedded into
		application servers, such as Websphere or Oracle. It supports IBM Http Server
		versions 1.3.x, 2.0.x and 6.0.x, and Oracle Http Server.</para>

			<listitem>Uncomment (if necessary) the line which loads the mod_status.so module.</listitem>
			<listitem>Uncomment (if necessary) the line which adds the mod_status.c module.</listitem>
			<listitem>Check that location /server-status is defined and access to it is allowed. If

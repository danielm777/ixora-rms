	<para>Allows monitoring of Windows operating systems. It accesses system's performance 
	data, therefore entities of this agent will reflect the same objects and instances
	found in Windows Performance Monitor.</para>

		<title>Local/Remote Modes</title>
		<para>The agent supports both local and remote modes. In 'local' mode it will
		attempt to remotely connect to the registry of the monitored host. Therefore the
		appropriate network permissions must be set before running in this mode.</para>

	<sect2 id="paraWindowsVersions">
		<title>Supported Versions</title>
		<para>The agent supports the following versions: Windows 2000, Windows 2003 and
		Windows XP. Please note that Windows XP Home Edition does not support remote registry 
		access, therefore such systems can only be monitored when running in 'remote' mode 
		(agent deployed on the monitored host).</para>

		<para>Domain, username and password can be specified when running in local mode and
		accessing a remote computer. Note that a Windows limitation prevents connection to the
		same computer with two user/passwords, therefore this feature will fail if the local
		system is already authenticated with a different user name. If this is the case, then
		you can use Windows Explorer to manually login to the network computer.</para>
		
		<para>If authentication was already performed through Windows Explorer, or if the user/password 
		used to log in locally are the same on both computers, then the user/domain/password fields 
		can be left blank.</para>

		<title>Contents</title>
		<para>The contents of the system performance data will vary depending of what version
		of Windows is monitored, and what applications are installed on each machine. Typically 
		this agent returns information about the computer and operating system (memory, CPU, 
		processes, network, disk etc), but many other applications may choose to expose their
		performance data here (eg. SQL Server, DB2, ASP.NET etc)</para>

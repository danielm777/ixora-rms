		clicking the 'Data Logging' button on the toolbar. Incoming data will start

		adjusting the aggregation interval.
		The aggregation interval is specified in seconds; all samples collected during this
		interval will be averaged into one value. Increasing this value can speed up considerably
		the replay of large log files, although at the expense of some detail.</p><p>Please note that some information (for intstance log file records) will never be aggregated no matter

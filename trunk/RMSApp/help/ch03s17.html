	entities and counters holding details about server's operations. Note that these
	statistics are only updated while the agent is running; SQL Server's activity will not
	be traced when the agent is stopped.</p><p>Note that more performance counters can be retrieved through the Windows agent.
	When using Windows agent on the host where SQL Server is installed, additional entities
	will appear in the tree.</p><a name="NDF4" class="indexterm"></a><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="paraSQLServerLocalRemote"></a>Local/Remote Modes</h3></div></div></div><p>The agent supports both local and remote modes, provided that it
		can open a database connection to the SQL Server from the machine it is
		deployed on. By default the standard SQL Server ODBC driver is used through
		the Java JDBC/ODBC bridge. If required it can be replaced with a different
		driver.</p><p>For the purposes of license management it may be important to know that
		the agent uses one database connection for as long as it's running, closing
		it when it is stopped. When agent is stopping, a second connection is briefly
		opened and closed.</p></div><a name="NE02" class="indexterm"></a><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="paraSQLServerVersions"></a>Supported Versions</h3></div></div></div><p>This agent supports Microsoft SQL Server 7.0, SQL Server 2000 and

		not always be the case, a better option would be to enable SQL Server authentication, which
		will allow you to specify an user and password. To enable SQL Server Authentication select
		the Security tab on the server properties in Enterprise Manager:</p><div class="figure"><a name="NE1A"></a><div><img src="images/sql_config.png" alt="Enabling SQL Server Authentication"></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;22.&nbsp;Enabling SQL Server Authentication</b></p></div><p>The following configuration options are available:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Username: user name to use when connecting to SQL Server.</li><li>Password: password to use when connecting to SQL Server.</li><li>Instance: either the server name, or the server and instance name to

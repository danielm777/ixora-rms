	the agent cannot monitor using an Application Client or Websphere system installed in a path which contains spaces (eg c:/Program Files).
	Please note that when monitoring a remote Websphere system the only requirement is that the Application Client on the console machine be
	installed in a path without spaces; the monitored system is not subjected to this kind of restriction.</p><a name="N1068" class="indexterm"></a><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="paraWebsphereHowToSetup"></a>How to setup WebSphere for monitoring</h3></div></div></div><p>Before activating the WebSphere agents you must enable the monitoring service for the servers that you wish to monitor. Details are given below on how to do this for different versions of WebSphere:</p><p>WebSphere 5.x:</p><p>In the Administration Console follow this path through the menu:
		'Servers &gt; Application Servers &gt; [serverName] &gt; Performance Monitoring Service', check the 'Startup' box and select 'Standard' as the 'Initial Specification Level'
		Repeat this for every server that you intend to monitor.
		Press the 'Ok' button and restart all servers.</p><p>WebSphere 6.x:</p><p>In the Administration Console follow this path through the menu:
		'Monitoring and Tunning &gt; Performance Monitoring Infrastructure (PMI) &gt; [serverName]' you must check the 'Enable Performance Monitoring Infrastructure (PMI)' checkbox and choose at least 'Extended' for 'Currently monitored statistics set'
		Repeat this for every server that you intend to monitor.
		For WebSphere 6.0.x there is one extra step: you must decrease the logging and tracing level in order to avoid some warning messages being written to the log file every time a performance snapshot is taken. Follow the following steps: navigate to 'Logging and Tracing &gt; [serverName] &gt; Change Log Detail Levels'. In the 'Configuration' pane select the '[All Components]', click and select the 'severe' level and then press the 'Ok' button.
		Now restart all servers for the changes to take effect.</p><p>Now depending on your environment you are probably in one of following situations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Your WebSphere instance is intalled on the console host. This is probably the case if you use IxoraRMS in a development environment:
You can run the WebSphere agent in 'Local' mode without any additional steps.</li><li>You want to monitor WebSphere servers in a remote location and you don't have WebSphere installed on the console host:
In order to get IxoraRMS console to connect to a remote WebSphere server you need to install on the console workstation the 'Application Client' package which is available on one of your WebSphere CDs. The following is a link on the IBM's website about installing the Client Application for WebSphere 6.0; similar documents are also available for WebSphere 5.0 and 5.1.<a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tcli_installclient.html" target="_top">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tcli_installclient.html</a>
Once you have the client application environment set-up you can run the monitoring agent on the console workstation in 'Local' mode</li><li>You want to monitor WebSphere servers in a remote location and you don't have WebSphere installed on the console host. You also do not have the 'Application Client' installed on the console host:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li>You can run the agent in 'Remote' mode on the monitored host; in order to do this you must have IxoraRMS HostManager installed on the monitored host. NOTE: this is not recommended as the cost of monitoring will increase (in terms of CPU cycles and memory usage on the remote host)</li><li>You can run the agent in 'Remote' mode on a third host where you have either WebSphere or WebSphere Application Client installed. In this case you must specify the host to monitor in the agent configuration.</li></ul></div></li></ul></div></div><a name="N108D" class="indexterm"></a><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="paraWebSphereScreenshots"></a>Screenshots</h3></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a name="N1097"></a><div><img src="images/agent_was6_sshot.png" alt="Screenshot (WebSphere 6.x)"></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;33.&nbsp;Screenshot (WebSphere 6.x)</b></p></div></div><p></p><p></p></div></body></html>

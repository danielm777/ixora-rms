IxoraRMS is a tool for visualizing monitoring data. It is written in Java and has a Swing GUI. As part of my job I am sometimes involved in performance testing and analysis and I needed a tool with the following characteristics:
  * quick to deploy
  * able to provide rich amounts of monitoring data
  * able to automatically update the customized data views when the topology changes
  * and able to customize the following aspects by writing none or very little code:
    1. adding new monitoring agents
    1. data visualization
    1. adding complex reactions to trigger notifications and tuning/configuration advices

	<para>This contains information about how to install and run &programName;. Refer to <xref linkend="chUG"/> for a full
	overview of its features. IxoraRMS 1.3 requires J2SE 6.0 or above.</para>

		<para>To ensure maximum portability &programName; is distributed as a series of compressed files
		(zip or bz2) for supported platforms. The installation procedure consists in unzipping the
		appropriate file in the desired output directory. To uncompress use:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>Windows: use any graphical zip utility (such as WinZip).</listitem>
			<listitem>Linux: use the command:<programlisting role="linespecific">
   tar -xzvf x86-linux-no-vm.tar.gz</programlisting>
   			</listitem>
			<listitem>Solaris: use the command:<programlisting role="linespecific">
   bzip2 -dc x86-solaris-no-vm.tar.bzip | tar -xvf -</programlisting>
   			or the same command as for Linux, if the GNU freeware utilities are installed.</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>The Console is the main application component	which displays data collected from
		all monitored hosts in a graphical console. The Host Manager is the component responsible
		for collecting data from agents deployed on remote hosts and forwarding it to the console.</para>

		<title>Running &programName;</title>

		<para>The installation file for each platform contains both the Console and HostManager.
		To start them use:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>Console: run console.bat or console.sh</listitem>
			<listitem>HostManager: run hmStart.bat or hmStart.sh and to stop it run
			the corresponding hmStop script file; after the Host Manger had been started
			at least once with hmStart and configured you can use the generated script file
			hm.launch.bat or hm.lauch.sh file to start the Host Manager thereafter.</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>When running Console for the first time you will need to enter the license key, either
		purchased or received after downloading the evaluation version.</para>

		<para>Note that &programName; Console will try to communicate to all Host Managers through a
		bidirectional TCP/IP channel to offer the best user experience but if such a channel
		cannot be established (because of firewalls for instance), the console will use a polling mechanism
		to retrieve data from the Host Managers using a one way channel.</para>

		<para>Click the Load session button and select winsample.lperf if you are running on Windows.
		This will open a sample monitoring session with system information pertinent
		to the local machine using the Windows Agent.</para>

		<para>You can also start a monitoring session in a non-interactive manner using

		<programlisting role="linespecific">
		batchStart.bat(sh) [sessionName] [logFile]
		</programlisting>

		where the two parameters are the monitoring session name
		and the log file where monitoring data will be stored.
		To stop a session started with batchStart you must run batchStop.bat(sh)</para>

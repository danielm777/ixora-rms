		Data returned by this agent mirrors the information returned by DB2 GET SNAPSHOT 
		commands. The 'collect' flags will directly operate on DB2's monitor switches. When these 
		flags are turned off, some of the resulted entities and counters will not be displayed, or

		The following are some common errors and situations that might be encountered:

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>SQL1428N  The application is already attached to "instance_name" while the command 
issued requires an attachment to "other_instance" for successful execution: Make sure that the Instance and 
Database configuration paramters are set according to the instructions above.
</listitem>
			<listitem>SQL1336N The remote host "hostname" was not found: This happens when you are using an IP address in your monitoring session. Make the "hostname" available
			to the client TCP/IP system (the simplest way is to add it to the "hosts" file)</listitem>
			<listitem>No data is returned: Make sure that at least one connection exists to the database.</listitem>

	<para>This agent monitors instances of SQL Server and dynamically creates a number of
	entities and counters holding details about server's operations. Note that these
	statistics are only updated while the agent is running; SQL Server's activity will not
	be traced when the agent is stopped.</para>

	<para>Note that more performance counters can be retrieved through the Windows agent.
	When using Windows agent on the host where SQL Server is installed, additional entities
	will appear in the tree.</para>

		<title>Local/Remote Modes</title>
		<para>The agent supports both local and remote modes, provided that it
		can open a database connection to the SQL Server from the machine it is
		deployed on. By default the standard SQL Server ODBC driver is used through
		the Java JDBC/ODBC bridge. If required it can be replaced with a different
		driver.</para>

		<para>For the purposes of license management it may be important to know that
		the agent uses one database connection for as long as it's running, closing
		it when it is stopped. When agent is stopping, a second connection is briefly
		opened and closed.</para>

		<title>Configuration</title>
		<para>Note that by default a SQL server instance is configured for Windows authentication,
		which requires the remote user to a valid Windows user for the server machine. As this may
		not always be the case, a better option would be to enable SQL Server authentication, which
		will allow you to specify an user and password. To enable SQL Server Authentication select
		the Security tab on the server properties in Enterprise Manager:</para>

		<para>The following configuration options are available:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>Username: user name to use when connecting to SQL Server.</listitem>
			<listitem>Password: password to use when connecting to SQL Server.</listitem>
			<listitem>Instance: either the server name, or the server and instance name to
			connect to, in the form "serverName\instanceName".</listitem>
			<listitem>JDBC string (optional): allows you to specify the raw JDBC
			connection string, for example if you wish to use a different
			driver to connect to SQL Server. The above username, password and instance will be
			ignored when this is set.</listitem>
			<listitem>JDBC class: when using a custom JDBC string, you can also
			specify a different JDBC class (the default is Sun's JDBC/ODBC bridge).</listitem>
			<listitem>Cursors: Set to enable cursor events (required by Cursors
			entity). Disable to improve performance</listitem>

			<listitem>Sessions: Set to receive existing session information
			events (required by Sessions entity). Disable to improve performance</listitem>
			<listitem>Stored Procedures: Set to enable tracing stored procedure

		<para>Note that counters returned by this agent are dynamically calculated while

			<listitem>Cursors: traces cursor operations, such as the number of cursors
